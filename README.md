## What is it? 
An AB test user study website. Each survey consists of 20 questions whose answers are sampled from N methods. Here is the interface: 

Instruction page:
![intro](assets/intro.png)
Survey page:
![question](assets/question.png)
Result page:
![result](assets/result.png)


## How to use it?
- Put results from different methods under `userstudy/static/data/`. This code assumes the following structure:
    ```
    userstudy/static/data/
        1/
            1.png # or gif
            2.png
            ...
        2/
        ....
    ```
- Change some parameters in `view.py` e.g. the number of your methods. There are some other functions that are also very easy to customize, like how to sample methods, how to analyze results.
- Change you instruction page in `index.html`.
- Bring it live: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:port`
- Check results: go to `hostname:port/dump`
- Clear database: `python manage.py flush`
